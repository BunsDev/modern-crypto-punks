## React Nft Challenge.

In this application we build a modern Cryptopunk clone with React Js & Web 3.0.

- Using Thirdweb to build the backend needed for our Ethereum APP

- Using React JS to build the Frontend of our Web Application while we estabilish connection with our NFT collection on OpenSea.

The scripts will be upgrading occasionally with new features added. Stay tuned!!
