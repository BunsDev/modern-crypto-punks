## React Nft Challenge.

In this application we build a modern Cryptopunk clone with React Js & Web 3.0.<br>
The address as well as the punks are displayed dynamicaly from **Opensea Marketplace**.

In depth we are..

- Using Thirdweb to build the **backend** of our Ethereum-based app.

- Using React JS to build the **frontend** while we estabilish connection with our NFT collection on **OpenSea**.

The scripts will be upgrading occasionally with new features added. Stay tuned!!
